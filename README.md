# Discord-Roulette-Bot
A Discord bot that randomly kicks one user out of the server.

Multiple users in a server can start up a roulette and join. Once the roulette is executed, one user gets randomly chosen and kicked out of the server.
I am calling it a roulette because I initially imagined it functioning like russian roulette, but now it's just called that because it sounds cooler than "random kicker".
I might still update it in the future :)
