# Discord-Roulette-Bot
A Discord bot that randomly kicks one user out of the server.

Multiple users in a server can start up a roulette and join. Once the roulette is executed, one user gets randomly kicked out of the server.
I am calling it a roulette because it sounds cooler but it doesn't really function like one... Possible future update :)
